I am a third year PhD student in computer science at the University of Washington, advised by [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/). My primary research topic is reasoning, with a dual focus: developing algorithms for improving language models' reasoning skills, and understanding the limitations of current models in reasoning tasks. I am particularly interested in theory of mind reasoning, where I did research for story comprehension setups and multi-agent reinforcement learning setups; and in accurately characterizing and quantifying models' skills. 

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uNPtZgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for an updated list of publications. Published works include Faith and Fate (NeurIPS 2023 Spotlight) and SymbolicToM (ACL 2023 Outstanding Paper Award).

## Before the PhD program

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires, with a heavy focus in Mathematics. I did my Master's thesis in visual search modeling (**oral presentation at SVRHM @ NeurIPS 2020, second-highest scoring paper** and recipient of the NVIDIA Diversity in AI Best Paper Award).

I was a **Lead Machine Learning Engineer at [ASAPP](https://asapp.com)**, where I developed models to efficiently rank text in real-time. Before that, I was a **Lead Data Scientist** at BrightSector, developing different NLP models for [the largest e-commerce site in Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MercadoLibre). I did two Software Engineer internships at Facebook, where I was granted two patents for my work in video stabilization (see [1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10582211B2/en), [2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10506248B2/en)).

I won several international **awards in mathematics and informatics** olympiads. Among them:
- Latin American Champion and First to Solve Problem F award at the World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (see [press coverage in the front page of the largest newspaper in Argentina](https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/uba-programacion-mundial_0_SJvhWKYv7e.html))
- Bronze Medal at the Ibero-American Olympiad in Mathematics ([I got to meet the president because of this!](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/informacion/archivo/25379-la-jefa-de-estado-recibio-al-equipo-argentino-que-participo-de-las-olimpiadas-internacionales-de-matematicas))
- Silver Medal at the South American Olympiad in Mathematics
- National Champion at the Argentinian Mathematical Olympiad
- National Champion at the Argentinian Programming Tournament

I also won some **awards in machine learning** competitions at a national level:
- first prize at the 2017 University of Buenos Aires' School of Informatics challenge (+150 teams competing)
- second prize in the 2018 University of Buenos Aires' School of Informatics challenge

I am very grateful for the **scholarships** I received throughout my studies:
- *Scholarship - Award City of Buenos Aires*, awarded by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires to the top 25 students in the city
- *Bicentennial Scholarship*, received from the National Argentinian Government

Besides Math and CS, I love **languages** and **teaching**. I speak Spanish, English, French and Portuguese, and was a teaching assistant at the University of Buenos Aires for over 3 years. I've also been a coach for mathematics olympiads, both in schools and as a private tutor.
