**I am currently on the industry job market for 2025-2026!** I'm particularly interested in building reliable and socially-aware AI systems.

I am a final-year PhD student at the University of Washington, advised by [Yejin Choi](https://yejinc.github.io/) and [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/). I was a visiting researcher at Meta FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), Superintelligence Labs from 2023–2025.

My research focuses on robust reasoning[^1] in language models—both developing algorithms to improve reasoning capabilities and rigorously characterizing models' skills and performance variance. Some of my work focuses particularly on theory of mind reasoning, with experience spanning from LLMs to multi-agent RL setups.

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uNPtZgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for publications, including an **ACL 2023 Outstanding Paper Award**, NeurIPS 2023 Spotlight, and ICLR & COLM 2025 Orals.

Before grad school, I spent four years in industry doing NLP, and was both a **mathematics olympiad champion and Latin America champion of the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)** among other awards.

[^1]: I know, I know, everyone says this nowadays. But I swear I was doing this before it was cool!

## Before the PhD program -- written in 2020

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires, with a heavy focus in Mathematics. I did my Master's thesis in visual search modeling (**oral presentation at SVRHM @ NeurIPS 2020, second-highest scoring paper** and recipient of the NVIDIA Diversity in AI Best Paper Award).

I was a **Lead Machine Learning Engineer at [ASAPP](https://asapp.com)**, where I developed models to efficiently rank text in real-time. Before that, I was a **Lead Data Scientist** at BrightSector, developing different NLP models for [the largest e-commerce site in Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MercadoLibre). I did two Software Engineer internships at Facebook, where I was granted two patents for my work in video stabilization (see [1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10582211B2/en), [2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10506248B2/en)).

I won several **international awards in mathematics and informatics olympiads**. Among them:
- Latin American Champion and First to Solve Problem F award at the World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (see [press coverage in the front page of the largest newspaper in Argentina](https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/uba-programacion-mundial_0_SJvhWKYv7e.html))
- Bronze Medal at the Ibero-American Olympiad in Mathematics ([I got to meet the president because of this!](https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/informacion/archivo/25379-la-jefa-de-estado-recibio-al-equipo-argentino-que-participo-de-las-olimpiadas-internacionales-de-matematicas))
- Silver Medal at the South American Olympiad in Mathematics
- National Champion at the Argentinian Mathematical Olympiad
- National Champion at the Argentinian Programming Tournament

I also won some **awards in machine learning** competitions at a national level:
- first prize at the 2017 University of Buenos Aires' School of Informatics challenge (+150 teams competing)
- second prize in the 2018 University of Buenos Aires' School of Informatics challenge

I am very grateful for the **scholarships** I received throughout my studies:
- *Scholarship - Award City of Buenos Aires*, awarded by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires to the top 25 students in the city
- *Bicentennial Scholarship*, received from the National Argentinian Government

Besides Math and CS, I love **languages** and **teaching**. I speak Spanish, English, French and Portuguese, and was a teaching assistant at the University of Buenos Aires for over 3 years. I've also been a coach for mathematics olympiads, both in schools and as a private tutor.
